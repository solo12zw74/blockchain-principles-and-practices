This repository was created thru passing a Pluralsight course calling [Blockchain. Principles and practices](https://app.pluralsight.com/library/courses/blockchain-principles-practices/table-of-contents). Thhe course giving the awesome bsics for understading of how blockchain works. And that knowledge is based on how the blockchain is implemeted.
The course provide very good materials using C# and that extermely helps understand the principles to me, as long as C# is the main language
I am using for a while.
